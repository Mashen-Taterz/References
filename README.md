I am reading through a Python cheat sheet and adding all the info into VS Code to get a better grasp on the syntax.
It is easier to read and looks nicer than the PDF I was reading from. 
It is also useful to be able to change some things and test them out.

Another thing to note is I am trying to get more familiar with Git / GitHub so I am probably not organised or doing things correctly.
I am just diving in head first and hoping to learn as I go.
